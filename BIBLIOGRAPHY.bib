@article{Bodhaine1999a,
abstract = {Many different techniques are used for the calculation of Rayleigh optical depth in the atmosphere. In some cases differences among these techniques can be important, especially in the UV region of the spectrum and under clean atmospheric conditions. The authors recommend that the calculation of Rayleigh optical depth be approached by going back to the first principles of Rayleigh scattering theory rather than the variety of curve- fitting techniques currently in use. A survey of the literature was conducted in order to determine the latest values of the physical constants necessary and to review the methods available for the calculation of Rayleigh optical depth. The recommended approach requires the accurate calculation of the refractive index of air based on the latest published measurements. Calculations estimating Rayleigh optical depth should be done as accurately as possible because the inaccuracies that arise can equal or even exceed other quantities being estimated, such as aerosol optical depth, particularly in the UV region of the spectrum. All of the calculations are simple enough to be done easily in a spreadsheet.},

@article{Breneman1987b,
abstract = {While each of his or her two eyes was independently adapted to a different illuminant in viewing a complex visual field, each of a number of observers matched a series of test colors seen by one eye with a juxtaposed variable stimulus seen by the other eye. The 2 degrees test and matching stimuli were located centrally in the complex adapting field, which subtended an angle of 31 degrees X 24 degrees. In making the matches, the observer viewed the test and matching stimuli for a series of brief intervals (approximately 1 sec) while viewing the complex adapting field with normal eye movements. Nine experiments were performed with different pairs of illuminants and different illuminances ranging from that of an average living room to that of a scene illuminated with hazy sunlight. In three other experiments each of the observer's two eyes was adapted to a different illuminance of D55. The amount of adaptation was more nearly complete at high levels of illuminance than at low levels, and the proportional amount of adaptation was less for the "blue" receptors. When adaptation coefficients were determined from the actual adaptation differences (e.g., from corresponding tristimulus values for matching neutrals) rather than from the adapting illuminants, a linear von Kries transformation based on experimentally determined visual primaries gave corresponding chromaticities that were in good agreement with the results obtained in each of the chromatic-adaptation experiments, except at the lowest illuminances. The results of the experiments in which each eye was adapted to different levels of the same illuminant indicated again that adaptation to the different levels was incomplete, the proportional amount of adaptation being less at low illuminances and for the "blue" receptors. This caused a change in chromatic adaptation with the level of illuminance even when the chromaticities of the adapting lights were equal. The results of these experiments also indicated that higher purities are needed in order to produce the same absolute color appearances at low levels of illuminance.},

To keep a corresponding (adapted) color within the positive gamut given by the chromatic adaptation primaries, the gamut must he within the cone primary octant. To contain adapted colors within the positive cone-primary octan, it suffices to truncate the action of adaptation at the boundary of that octant. Such modifications may be needed to avoid the mathematical problems in CIECAM02.},

abstract = {The color rendering index (CRI) has been shown to have deficiencies when applied to white light-emitting-diode–based sources. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the restricted scope of the CRI unnecessarily penalizes some light sources with desirable color qualities. To solve the problems of the CRI and include other dimensions of color quality, the color quality scale (CQS) has been developed. Although the CQS uses many of elements of the CRI, there are a number of fundamental differences. Like the CRI, the CQS is a test-samples method that compares the appearance of a set of reflective samples when illuminated by the test lamp to their appearance under a reference illuminant. The CQS uses a larger set of reflective samples, all of high chroma, and combines the color differences of the samples with a root mean square. Additionally, the CQS does not penalize light sources for causing increases in the chroma of object colors but does penalize sources with smaller rendered color gamut areas. The scale of the CQS is converted to span 0–100, and the uniform object color space and chromatic adaptation transform used in the calculations are updated. Supplementary scales have also been developed for expert users.},

For the purposes of unambiguously specifying the color an observer sees when looking through an optical filter at a well-defined light source, we have found the CIE Color Specification System to be the most accurate (for a simple and clear description, see [1]). In this article we briefly describe the method to calculate the three main parameters that fully specify color in this system: luminosity, dominant wavelength, and excitation purity. These terms specifically refer to the definitions in the CIE system given below, but they have analogies in many other systems. A set of more general terms often used to qualitatively describe color are: brightness, hue, and saturation (analogous to luminosity, dominant wavelength, and excitation purity, respectively). These terms (and others) are often used interchangeably. Here we will adhere to the official terms assigned to the CIE system to avoid any ambiguity.},

An experiment is described in which achromatic appearance is measured for various adapting conditions. The model is tested with these experimental results as well as results from another study and found to be significantly better at predicting corresponding colors than other proposed models.},

This system resembles the Adams chromatic-value system but replaces the quintic-parabola function with a cube-root function. For colors having reflectances greater than 0.5{\%} the color spacing obtained agrees with Munsell spacing as closely as the modified Adams system. At lower reflectances an expanded color spacing over that of the Munsell system is provided. The cube-root equations can be solved directly for color coordinate differences in terms of simple functions of the difference in colorimeter readings or tristimulus values. The computation of color coordinates in this system is simpler and requires less computational precision than other visually uniform color coordinate systems. A simple slide rule for computing color differences in cube-root color coordinates is described. A modification of the cube-root color coordinate system which provides nearly perfect representation of the spacing of Munsell colors is described, and the appropriateness of the assumptions required to obtain this behavior is discussed.},

abstract = {Natural outdoor illumination daily undergoes large changes in its correlated color temperature (CCT), yet existing equations for calculating CCT from chromaticity coordinates span only part of this range. To improve both the gamut and accuracy of these CCT calculations, we use chromaticities calculated from our measurements of nearly 7000 daylight and skylight spectra to test an equation that accurately maps CIE 1931 chromaticities x and y into CCT. We extend the work of McCamy [Color Res. Appl. 12, 285-287 (1992)] by using a chromaticity epicenter for CCT and the inverse slope of the line that connects it to x and y. With two epicenters for different CCT ranges, our simple equation is accurate across wide chromaticity and CCT ranges (3000-10(6) K) spanned by daylight and skylight.},

Among the many, transforms tested, this transform gave the most accurate predictions to a number of experimental data sets. However, the structure of CMCCAT97 is considered complicated and causes problems when applications require the use of its reverse mode. This article describes a simplified version of CMCCAT97-CMCCAT2000-which not only, is significantly, simpler and eliminates the problems of reversibility, but also gives a more accurate prediction to almost all experimental data sets than does the original transform.

The current video distribution environments deliver Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) signal Y′CbCr. For HDR and WCG content, it is desirable to examine if such signal format still works well for compression, and to know if the overall system performance can be further improved by exploring different signal formats. In this paper, ITP (ICTCP) colour space is presented. The paper concentrates on examining the two aspects of ITP colour space: 1) ITP characteristics in terms of signal quantization at a given bit depth; 2) ITP compression performance. The analysis and simulation results show that ITP 10 bit has better properties than Y′CbCr⁃PQ 10bit in colour quantization, constant luminance, hue property and chroma subsampling, and it also has good compression efficiency. Therefore it is desirable to adopt ITP colour space as a new signal format for HDR/WCG video compression.},

abstract = {A new colour model, named LLAB(l:c) is derived. It includes two parts: the BFD chromatic adaptation transform derived by Lam and Rigg, and a modified CIELAB uniform colour space. The model's performance was compared with the other spaces and models using the LUTCHI Colour Appearance Data Set. The results show that LLAB(l:c) model is capable of precisely quantifying the change of colour appearance under a wide range of viewing parameters such as light sources, surrounds/media, achromatic backgrounds, sizes of stimuli, and luminance levels. It had a similar performance as that of the Hunt colour appearance model. The LLAB(l:c) model was also tested using various colour difference datasets. The model gave a similar performance as the state-of-the-art colour difference formulae such as CMC, CIE94, and BFD. This performance is considered to be very satisfactory, and the model, therefore, should be considered for field trials in applications such as colour specification, colour difference evaluation, cross-image reproduction, gamut mapping, prediction of metamerism and colour constancy, and quantification of colour-rendering properties. The model does not give predictions for chroma (as distinct from colourfulness), or for brightness, and it does not include any rod response. {\textcopyright} 1996 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Can a single colour model be used for all colorimetric applications? This article intends to answer that question. Colour appearance models have been developed to predict colour appearance under different viewing conditions. They are also capable of evaluating colour differences because of their embedded uniform colour spaces. This article first tests the performance of the CIE 2002 colour appearance model, CIECAM02, in predicting three types of colour discrimination data sets: large- and small-magnitude colour differences under daylight illuminants and small-magnitude colour differences under illuminant A. The results showed that CIECAM02 gave reasonable performance compared with the best available formulae and uniform colour spaces. It was further extended to give accurate predictions to all types of colour discrimination data. The results were very encouraging in that the CIECAM02 extensions performed second best among all the colour models tested and only slightly poorer than the models that were developed to fit a particular data set. One extension derived to fit all types of data can predict well for colour differences having a large range of difference magnitudes. 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

By plotting the results on the I.C.I. color mixture diagram, the loci of points characterized by equal maximum efficiencies have been established.

@article{NationalElectricalManufacturersAssociation2004b,
abstract = {Two sensitive procedures to quantitate human exposure to endogenous N-nitroso compounds (NOC) and/or methylating agents have been developed. One, the NPRO test, is based on the excretion of N-nitrosoproline (NPRO) and other N-nitrosoamino acids in the urine, that are measured as an index of endogenous nitrosation, following ingestion of precursors. The NPRO test has been applied to human subjects in clinical and epidemiological studies, and the kinetics and dietary modifiers of endogenous nitrosation have been investigated. Results obtained after application of the NPRO test to subjects at high risk for cancers of the stomach, esophagus, oral cavity and urinary bladder are summarized. In most instances, higher exposures to endogenous NOC were found in high-risk subjects, but individual exposure was greatly affected by dietary modifiers or disease state. Vitamin C efficiently lowered the body burden of intragastrically formed NOC. In experimental animals 3-methyladenine (3-MeAde) is excreted in urine following exposure to methylating NOC. Humans normally excrete 3-MeAde, the origin of which remains unknown. Recently developed analytical methodology permits large numbers of human urine samples to be analyzed and a wide variation is observed. Preliminary results suggest a weak correlation between basal NPRO excretion and background 3-MeAde excretion. Taken together, the results point to an etiological role of endogenously formed NOC in certain human cancers, and provide an interpretation of epidemiological findings that have shown protective effects of fruits and vegetables against several malignancies.},

The newly defined loci of constant hue have been extended closer to the extremes of value while the loci of constant chroma have been extrapolated to the pigment maximum. The dimension of value has been redefined without substantial departure from the Munsell-Sloan-Godlove scale. By the above changes a solid is achieved which approaches more closely to A. H.

The hue is a normalized (barycentric) triangle with pure red, green, and blue at the vertices, often called the Maxwell Color Tri- angle. Each cross section of the space is the same barycentric triangle, and the light/dark dimension runs zero to one for each hue so the whole color volume takes the form of a prism. This prismatic space has advantages computationally and intuitively for some common color operations used in computer graphics and image processing.},

@article{Susstrunk1999a,
abstract = {This paper describes the specifications and usage of standard RGB color spaces promoted today by standard bodies and/or the imaging industry. As in the past, most of the new standard RGB color spaces were developed for specific imaging workflow and applications. They are used as interchange spaces to communicate color and/or as working spaces in imaging applications. Standard color spaces can facilitate color communication: if an image is in ‘knownRGB,' the user, application, and/or device can unambiguously understand the color of the image, and further color manage from there if necessary. When applied correctly, a standard RGB space can minimize color space conversions in an imaging workflow, improve image reproducibility, and facilitate accountability.$\backslash$nThe digital image color workflow is examined with emphasis on when an RGB color space is appropriate, and when to apply color management by profile. An RGB space is “standard” because either it is defined in an official standards document (a de jure standard) or it is supported by commonly used tools (a de facto standard). Examples of standard RGB color spaces are ISO RGB, sRGB, ROMM RGB, Adobe RGB 98, Apple RGB, and video RGB spaces (NTSC, EBU, ITU-R BT.709). As there is no one RGB color space that is suitable for all imaging needs, factors to consider when choosing an RGB color space are discussed.},
